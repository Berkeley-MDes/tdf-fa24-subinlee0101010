## Reflections

This week, I focused on **user research** to better understand the needs of people with atopic dermatitis. I conducted interviews to identify their biggest challenges, such as unconscious scratching and managing triggers. I also analyzed **31 existing atopic dermatitis apps** available on app stores. Most apps had limited functionality, like tracking symptoms, but none offered **scratch detection** or integrated **gamification** for behavior change.

Additionally, I started designing the app in **Figma**, creating an early prototype that includes features like scratch detection alerts and habit-forming gamified elements. This week’s research helped me confirm the need for **motion sensors** to detect scratching and identify gaps in existing solutions.

## Speculations

Next week, I’ll begin integrating **motion sensor technology** into the app prototype to test its ability to detect scratching motions. I’ll also explore **machine learning models** to improve detection accuracy and start planning the **photon implementation**.

In the future, the app could incorporate **biometric data** (e.g., skin temperature) and **environmental data** (e.g., humidity) to provide users with personalized alerts and recommendations. Combining wearable technology with gamification could make managing atopic dermatitis both effective and engaging.

## Images and Diagrams

I have included a **Figma prototype screenshot** showing the app's core features:

## Conclusion

This week’s research and initial prototyping set a solid foundation for the project. I identified key user needs and gaps in current apps while creating a design tailored to those needs. Next, I’ll focus on building the motion detection system and further developing app functionality.
