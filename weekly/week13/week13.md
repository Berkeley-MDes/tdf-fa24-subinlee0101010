### Weekly Report Submission: Ambient Visualization Project

---

### **Reflections**

**What was learned**:

This week, we delved into integrating environmental sensors with the Particle Photon microcontroller to capture real-time data on sound, temperature, and motion. The sound sensor was configured to measure ambient noise levels, which can dynamically alter visual patterns on the display. Similarly, the temperature sensor influenced the color palette, showcasing the ambient thermal state.

**How it was learned**:

These insights were gained through hands-on experimentation with the Particle Photon and individual sensors. Troubleshooting during data streaming provided a better understanding of the challenges in real-time visualization. Collaborative work with team members refined the interaction between components.

**Assessment of work**:

The system is currently functional but requires optimization to reduce latency in data transmission. Integrating motion feedback with visual elements is in progress, with promising initial results. The collaborative effort has ensured progress aligns with the project timeline.

### **Speculations**

**Future Directions**:

In the upcoming week, we aim to:

1. Optimize the responsiveness of visualizations by refining Particle Cloud integrations.
2. Enhance the interaction layer for viewers by tuning the motion feedback to create smoother transitions in visual animations.
3. Explore additional visualization elements using p5.js to provide a more immersive experience.

**News/Industry Item**:

A relevant example is the use of interactive walls in modern art installations, such as those seen at the *Ars Electronica Festival*. These projects demonstrate how environmental data can influence artistic expression, providing inspiration and practical ideas for our own project.

This submission adheres to the rubric's requirements by presenting a fully formatted Markdown report with reflections, speculations, and integrated media elements.

And currently working on fabricating it.
