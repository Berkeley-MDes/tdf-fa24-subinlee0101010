## Getting Familiar with Rhino

**my background**

- Never tried Rhino & Grasshopper
- only tried Maya… and definitely not skilled at it

1. opened CellPhoneStand.3dm file

1. Opened Grasshopper file : CellPhoneStand_Simple_2024.gh

Explored  by adjusting the parameters from Grasshopper and experimented how what kind of changes are made in Rinho

1. BAKE

what is baking ?

## Overview of interaction

Any changes made in Grasshopper (such as parameter adjustments or logic changes) are reflected instantly in Rhino. Similarly, if Rhino geometry is altered and referenced in Grasshopper, it can trigger updates in the Grasshopper-generated design
