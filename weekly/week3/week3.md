**Weekly Progress Report: The Do Not Forget Stand**

---

### Reflections:

This week, I focused on finalizing the design of "The Do Not Forget Stand" and refining the dimensions for the slots that hold my phone, keys, wallet, watch, and pen. One key insight I gained was how crucial it is to consider human factors in design. For instance, the width and depth of each slot needed to accommodate objects of different sizes while maintaining ease of access. I learned this through trial and error by fabricating different prototypes and testing them for functionality.

Working with the laser cutter allowed me to better understand the precision required when working with plywood, particularly regarding material thickness. I learned to adjust the design in Illustrator to account for kerf (the width of material removed by the laser) to ensure a snug fit for the pieces.

The project is progressing well. The prototype is functional, but I plan to refine the aesthetic aspects next, ensuring the stand is not only practical but also visually appealing.

### Speculations:

Looking ahead, I believe tools like laser cutters will become more accessible and user-friendly, with improvements in software integration. AI-driven design tools may eventually assist in generating design suggestions based on user behavior, improving the functionality of products like "The Do Not Forget Stand." I envision AI suggesting personalized layouts based on an individual's habits, optimizing both space and time management.

For my project, the next step is to explore modularity, allowing users to customize the stand to fit their specific needs. This could include adjustable sections for different-sized items or even collapsible components for portability. With the rapid development of AI and manufacturing technologies, I think weâ€™ll see an increase in personalized design tools, making it easier for non-experts to create solutions tailored to their daily routines.
