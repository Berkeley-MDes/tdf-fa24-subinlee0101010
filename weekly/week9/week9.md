Project 3 Understanding Use Cases, Value, and Design with LLMs

- new tool for rapid prototyping of LLM-based agents called ZeroWidth.

I was both excited and slightly apprehensive about using ZeroWidth, as each new platform comes with a unique set of functions, controls, and workflows. However, the structure of the class, along with the hands-on approach, provided a supportive environment to dive right in.

Getting started with ZeroWidth, I created my first agent flow, calling it "Experiment One," with plans to use it as my sandbox for testing and familiarizing myself with the tool. I enjoyed how ZeroWidth’s layout shared similarities with other visual tools I’ve used before, like Grasshopper, with columns of icons that serve as quick access points for various features. This familiarity made it easier to settle in and focus on experimenting rather than spending too much time on basic orientation.

Using the settings and icon controls, I discovered options for panning and zooming—features that felt natural and intuitive for designing an agent flow. As I began to add elements and design my experiment, I could see the power of ZeroWidth in rapidly iterating and organizing LLM-based workflows. Despite it being my first attempt, the exploratory process helped me build confidence, revealing how quickly I could set up and test different agent functionalities.

This experience reinforced my confidence in learning new tools and adjusting to different design environments. Moving forward, I’m excited to see how ZeroWidth will enable me to iterate on my ideas and create LLM agents that address practical use cases, combining my growing knowledge of LLM design with a hands-on prototyping tool.
