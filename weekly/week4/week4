#speculation
This week, we had a chance to share videos of our projects during class, and I was really impressed by the variety of designs my classmates came up with using Rhino and Grasshopper. Seeing everyoneâ€™s unique approach was both inspiring and surprising.
The feedback sessions were helpful. A few classmates gave me great suggestions on how to improve the visual appeal of my project, and they were curious to see more of the behind-the-scenes work in Grasshopper, which made me rethink how I present my process next time. I really appreciated the positive vibes and constructive input from everyone. To contribute more, I think I could help organize small group sessions to share tips and tricks on Rhino and Grasshopper. That could be a fun way to improve our skills together.
