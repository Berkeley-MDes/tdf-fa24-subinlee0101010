## Reflections

This week, I worked on testing different ways to set up and use language agents, which are systems that answer questions or give information. I tried five different setups to see how they affected the agents' responses. Through these tests, I learned that using clear instructions and adjusting settings like temperature (which controls creativity in responses) made a big difference in how helpful and accurate the agents were.

The project is going well so far. The experiments gave me helpful ideas about what works best when designing agents that are easy for people to use.

## Speculations

In the future, I want to improve how the agent finds and uses information by making instructions even clearer. I’d also like to create templates to help the agent respond to questions based on specific details like location, year, and topic. This way, the agents can give more personalized and useful answers.

I recently read about Google’s work on making their AI assistants more responsive to real-time information. [You can read about it here.](https://example-link.com/) This news shows how important it is to design AI that’s adaptable to different user needs.

## Conclusion

This week’s work helped me learn how to design agents that give helpful answers and respond well to different questions. In the coming weeks, I’ll keep improving the way agents find and use information. Adding more visuals in future updates will also help explain the project better.
