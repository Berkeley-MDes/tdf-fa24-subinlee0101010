It was good to explore different ways to print laser cut.

### PLUS

Based on the design concepts we learned, I decided to design a specific object, like a phone holder. I focused on the idea that the phone is only on the holder when it’s not in use.

I created a design using cardboard for a phone holder that encourages couples to put down their phones and engage in conversation with each other.

Basically, you put two phones here, and focus on each other rather than using phones!
